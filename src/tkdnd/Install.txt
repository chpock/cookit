                 tkdnd Installation Instructions
             ---------------------------------------

DOWNLOAD:

tkdnd can be downloaded from the SourceForge CVS server.
For more information, please refer to the SourceForge web site at
    http://tkdnd.sourceforge.net/

The official home page of the extension is at 
    http://tkdnd.sourceforge.net/

Currently, the supported platforms are only Microsoft Windows & Unix.
The source distribution contains anything you need in order to build the
extension under any of the supported platforms (tkdnd.tar.gz)

Installation:
----------------

1) Microsoft Windows:
  If your platform is Microsoft Windows, then allong with the distribution
  there is a stubs enabled dynamic library (dll) that was built against
  ActiveTcl 8.3.4.1, with the use of VC++ 6.0. If you cannot use the
  provided binary, then you can always create the required library by using
  the VC++ project files located in the "win" directory of the tkdnd
  distribution.  In all other cases, you should create the library only
  from the files located in the directories "win" (*.cpp *.h) and "generic"
  (*.c *.h).  You will need a C++ compiler for this. Please note that all
  files must be compiled as C++ files (even though they have a ".c"
  extension), or undefined symbols will remain. Under VC++ 5.0 this can be
  done with the /TP switch.  If you fail in forcing your compiler to treat
  these files as C++ sources, you can safely rename all of them to
  *.cpp. If these files are compiled as C source files, then you will not
  be able to link the shared object (dll), as different naming conversions
  will be used.

2) Unix:
  If your platform is Unix you can use the "standard" procedure, as tkdnd
  is TEA compliant: configure-make-make install.

  * Change your working director to the "unix" directory of the tkdnd
    distribution.

  * Then run the "configure" script. This script will try to create suitable
    Makefiles for your opeating system. If you have problems running this
    script, try running the tcl script "tcl-conf".

  * Type "make". This will create a (stubs enabled) dynamic library that can be
    loaded from a tk interpreter (i.e. wish v8.3.3+).
    You can additionally try the default demo applications, by typing
    "make tests".
  
  * If everything seems to work fine, you can install the extension by typing
    "make install". According to the parameters given to the configure script
    (especially --prefix), you may need super-user priviledges in order to
    complete this step. If the procedure for any reason fails, just copy
    the contents of the "lib" directory into a directory that tcl looks in
    order to load extensions.

3) Macintosh
   This platform is not supported yet. If anyone wants to help (and of course
   has a mac :-)) please contact the authors.
