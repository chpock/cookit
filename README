INSTALLKIT

This is the source code for the installkit that powers the
platform-specific elements of InstallJammer.


BUILDING

$ ./configure && make
$ make dist

The toplevel configure script is not a traditional autoconf script as all
it does is setup the environment for the build.  The configuration of the
rest of the components will be done during the make since things have
to be bootstrapped in a particular order to build the rest.

The 'make dist' is only used to build a .zip of the resulting binaries if
you want to send them back to the InstallJammer project.  If InstallJammer
doesn't already support the platform you are building, we would certainly
appreciate you sending us the binaries to add to our platform list. 0-]
